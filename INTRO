New York City's demographics show that it is a large and ethnically diverse metropolis. It is the largest city in
the United States with a long history of international immigration. New York City was home to nearly 9.3 million
people in 2016, accounting for over 40% of the population of New York State and a slightly lower percentage of
the New York metropolitan area, home to approximately 23.6 million. Over the last decade the city has been
growing faster than the region. The New York region continues to be by far the leading metropolitan gateway for
legal immigrants admitted into the United States.

Throughout its history, New York City has been a major point of entry for immigrants; the term "melting pot" was
coined to describe densely populated immigrant neighborhoods on the Lower East Side. As many as 500+
languages are spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. English remains
the most widely spoken language, although there are areas in the outer boroughs in which up to 25% of people
speak English as an alternate language, and/or have limited or no English language fluency. English is least
spoken in neighborhoods such as Flushing, Sunset Park, and Corona.
